# Character LCD Interface with Tiva LaunchPad

This project demonstrates how to interface a 16×2 character LCD module with the Tiva C LaunchPad. It includes low-level routines for initialization, command writing, and text display.

## Features
- LCD initialization sequence  
- Writing characters and strings  
- Cursor control  
- Timing logic for LCD command execution  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Digital I/O handling  
- Timing and delays for LCD commands  
- Low-level driver development  
- Embedded C on ARM Cortex-M  

## Hardware
- Tiva C LaunchPad (TM4C123G)  
- 16×2 Character LCD  
- Potentiometer (LCD contrast)  
- Breadboard & wiring
